<h1>The Best Movies According to Michael</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Die Hard</h3>
<p>This is a classic action movie that I can watch, and have, watched over 1000 times. Also counts as a Christmas movie.</p>

<h3>Dredd</h3>
<p>Fantastic dark/sci-fi/dystopian gritty cop movie. As of writing this I just noticed how similar it and Die Hard are.</p>

<h3>300</h3>
<p>Fantastic action movie adaptation of an a-historic graphic novel.</p>
